# cpt-ospf-dns-http
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of key protocols: DNS, OSPF, and HTTP in Cisco Packet Tracer. Routers are configured with the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) link-state routing protocol .The DNS server enables domain name resolution, allowing clients to access web services hosted on the HTTP server using user-friendly URLs.
